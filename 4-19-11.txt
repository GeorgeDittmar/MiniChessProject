AI NOTES 4-19-11

Incremental eval just checks to see if a piece was taken and if so then subtract that piece score from the board.

better way
- keep global variable E which is eval of the starting board, so zero.
	- whenever move is made e += piece value of piece captured
	- if undo is done -= value of the piece that is brought back
	
	- add a end search value that gets the heck out of the recursive call so it stop searching period.
